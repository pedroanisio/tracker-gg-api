## üí° Example Conversations

### **Basic Player Analysis**
```
User: "Analyze PlayerName#1234's performance"

AI: I'll analyze PlayerName#1234's performance for you. Let me gather their data...

[Uses MCP tools to fetch player data]

Based on the analysis of PlayerName#1234's recent performance:

**Performance Summary:**
‚Ä¢ 45 matches played in the last 30 days
‚Ä¢ 1.23 K/D ratio (above average)
‚Ä¢ 67% win rate in competitive
‚Ä¢ 245 average combat score

**Strengths:**
‚Ä¢ Consistent aim with 24% headshot rate
‚Ä¢ Strong clutch performance (78% 1v1 win rate)
‚Ä¢ Excellent map awareness shown in low death count

**Areas for Improvement:**
‚Ä¢ Ability usage could be optimized (low util damage)
‚Ä¢ Entry fragging potential underutilized
‚Ä¢ Consider expanding agent pool beyond current 2 mains

**Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Focus on ability combos in aim training
‚Ä¢ Practice entry strategies on Ascent and Bind
‚Ä¢ Try Initiator agents to complement playstyle
```

### **Trend Analysis**
```
User: "How has their performance changed in the last week?"

AI: Let me compare their recent performance to their longer-term trends...

[Analyzes performance data across different time periods]

**Recent Performance Trends (Last 7 days vs Previous 30 days):**

**Positive Changes:**
‚Ä¢ K/D improved from 1.23 to 1.45 (+18%)
‚Ä¢ Win rate increased from 67% to 78% (+11%)
‚Ä¢ ADR improved by 23 points

**Areas of Concern:**
‚Ä¢ Slightly fewer matches played (might indicate tilt)
‚Ä¢ Headshot % decreased by 3%

**Analysis:**
The player is clearly on an upward trajectory! The improved K/D and win rate suggest they've recently addressed some fundamental issues. The slight dip in headshot percentage while maintaining higher K/D indicates better positioning and game sense.

**Recommendation:**
Keep the current momentum going. The reduced match count might indicate they're being more selective about when they play, which is actually positive for avoiding tilt.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **"AI agent error: Authentication failed"** or **"Could not resolve authentication method"**
- **Check .env file**: Ensure you have created a `.env` file in the project root
- **Verify API key**: Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
- **Key format**: Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the API key
- **File location**: The `.env` file must be in the project root directory
- **Restart server**: Restart the FastAPI server after modifying the `.env` file
- **API key validity**: Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- **Environment loading**: Check that `python-dotenv` is installed

**Example .env file:**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-abcd1234...
```

#### **"Error executing tool: Player not found"**
- Verify the player exists in your database
- Check the Riot ID format (username#tag)
- Ensure data ingestion has been completed

#### **"No data returned from tool"**
- Check database connectivity
- Verify the player has sufficient data for analysis
- Check if the requested time period has data

#### **Chat interface not responding**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the FastAPI server is running
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### **Performance Optimization**
- The AI responses are cached to improve speed
- Large time ranges may take longer to analyze
- Consider reducing conversation history for faster responses

## üîê Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control
